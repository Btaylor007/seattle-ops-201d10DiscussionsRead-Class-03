Introduction to Help Desk Support Roles
What role does the help desk professional play within an organization, particularly in relation to customers? The help desk is the first view of the company that the customer interacts with when experiencing any issues. 
The article differentiates between hard and soft skills. In your culture or community, are there specific skills that are highly valued? How do they compare to the skills mentioned in the article?  I think in the It community it really is about who you know and then hard and soft skills. I think that a person could have both hard and soft skills and still have a hard time getting into the field. My last job I feel like was focused more on the soft skills and not the hard skills. You could have something in ticket status for weeks but as long as it was properly documented no one batted an eye.
Why have security skills become more important in recent years for help desk technicians? Because cybercriminals are becoming more and more prevalent and help desk technicians need to be vigilant to possible attacks on not just the customers but the company as well.
How do writing skills and critical thinking skills play a vital role in the work of help desk technicians? Writing skills play an important part in the help desk and company improvement process. These skills show what the customer had to deal with, what the technician did to find, troubleshoot, and resolve the issue. Critical thinking gives help for troubleshooting or coming up with resolutions for any issues being had whether with a customer or company life.
